      <p class="introhead">
        My name is Nitin Thengde and I am a Software Engineer.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am from Kharadi, Pune, and I have completed my C-DAC certification
        from KP Bangalore. I have nearly a year of experience in product
        development and am proficient in technologies such as Java, JavaScript,
        Node.js, MySQL, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, React.js, JDBC, MongoDB,
        Git, and Postman. <br />
        More recently, I worked with Grawlix Software, where my responsibilities
        included developing new functionalities, solving critical problems,
        fixing coding issues, enhancing application performance, managing
        databases, and assisting testers in testing the application. <br />
        I worked on the company's byproduct called Talboard, a human staffing
        system designed to manage various activities within a company, such as
        client management, vendor management, placements, invoicing, and payroll
        management. <br />
        Additionally, I worked on the Bravia Hotels Project, an online booking
        system that simplifies hotel reservations. It is part of Booking
        Holdings and operates globally, offering services in multiple languages
        and currencies. <br />
        At this point, I am exploring new opportunities where I can apply my
        skills and expertise in software development, contribute to impactful
        projects, and continue growing in my career. <br />
